Overall, it appears that charter schools outperform district schools. Interestingly enough, charter students have a lower “per student budget”. Additionally, reading scores are higher than math for all grades in almost all of the schools.Perhaps there should be a stronger focus on raising math grades. Lastly, Medium/Small school sizes score better than large school even though they have less funding.
